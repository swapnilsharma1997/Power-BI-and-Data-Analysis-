DAX Measures:
Total Sales :  Sales = SUM(Sales_Data[Sales])
Previous Year Toal Sales: Sales PY = CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
Difference Between Current Year Sales & Previous Year Sales: Sales vs PY = [Sales] - [Sales PY]
Percentage Increase or Decrease in sales year on year (YOY%) : Sales vs py % = DIVIDE([Sales vs PY],[Sales],0)
Products Sold = SUM(Sales_Data[Order Quantity])
Profit = SUM(Sales_Data[Profit]) 
Profit LY = CALCULATE([Profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
Profit Vs LY = [Profit]- [Profit LY]
Profit vs LY % = [Profit Vs LY]/[Profit]
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Profit],[Sales],0)
Total Cost = SUM(Sales_Data[Total Cost])
